1. Users should be able to right click, and have an extra selection "Custom Block"
- Custom Block
- Cut
- Copy
- Paste

2. Remove the Preview section, as you already have a scrollable element where users can edit
- Make this editable element show 10 lines

3. If a block ONLY consists of a function 
- When the user connects the block to another block, update the block (the function one) "Output" header to be the output type of the function, similiar to how vscode shows the input/output of a function

4. I want the Block Palette to have a nested UI 
- Show Header Titles, when clicked they navigate to the content of that pack
For example
Basic Python
Images
Tensorflow
Pytorch
Linear Regression Models
Neural Networks
CNN

and when a user clicks one of these categories they will be able to see all relevant code blocks for that item

5. I want to change the way you interpret new code blocks
Currently it seems that they are stored as JSON within the builtins folder

I want to change it to be more ordered and quickly reproduceable
I created a "Categories" folder with several other category folders within it (Each are number labelled to indicate order)
Each category folder has a list of .py files that dictate the different sections for that category (Each are number labelled to indicate order)
in each .py file the first line has a comment 
# Category: _______
the value for category should be the name for the subsection
in the file there are several code blocks, the start and end of each code block is specified by
# START
and
# END
the next two lines after the start are
# Title: ______
# Output: _____
the value for title should be the name of that block 
and the output value should be the value for the output

after the output, and until the end of the file, is the actual python block code
I have already created some examples, look over how i did it, implement more examples for the rest, and adjust the code accordingly

Remember that the use should be able to navigate between category, and then section, and then select blocks that belong to that section (include a back button)

Also if easily possible, include a search button at the top, that performs a fuzzy search for related blocks, and navigates the user to that section, and focus on the block

6. Can we also make the drag animation more interactable, so the user can clearly see it while it is being dragged, currently they click+hold and place somewhere, seemingly teleporting

7. Can we make the input a green circle, and the output a red circle so it is clearer what goes where

8. Add a arrow incremently on the wires so the user can understand which way the data is flowing, as of right now its just a wire and unclear where the wire is going
