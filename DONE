To Publish:
Step 1: Install VS Code Extension Manager
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
Step 2: Get a Personal Access Token
Go to https://dev.azure.com
Sign in with your Microsoft account
Create an organization (if needed)
Go to User Settings → Personal Access Tokens
Create a new token with Marketplace (Manage) permissions
Save the token securely
Step 3: Create a Publisher
vsce create-publisher ahmad
Or create it at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
Step 4: Build your extension
npm run build
This compiles TypeScript and builds the webview.
Step 5: Package the extension (test first)
vsce package
This creates a .vsix file you can test locally:
In VS Code: Extensions → ... → Install from VSIX
Step 6: Publish to Marketplace
vsce publish
You'll be prompted for your Personal Access Token.
Step 7: Verify
After publishing, check:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode
Search for "MLBlocks"

## Development

1. Install dependencies for the extension root:
   - `npm install`
2. Install dependencies for the webview app:
   - `npm --prefix src/webview/app install`
3. Build:
   - `npm run build`
4. Run the extension:
   - Press `F5` in VSCode.
   

# FIRST
1. Users should be able to right click, and have an extra selection "Custom Block"
- Custom Block
- Cut
- Copy
- Paste

2. Remove the Preview section, as you already have a scrollable element where users can view/edit
- Make this editable element show 10 lines

3. If a block ONLY consists of a function 
- When the user connects the block to another block, update the block (the function one) "Output" header to be the output type of the function, similiar to how vscode shows the input/output of a function

4. I want the Block Palette to have a nested UI 
- Show Header Titles, when clicked they navigate to the content of that pack
For example
Basic Python
Images
Tensorflow
Pytorch
Linear Regression Models
Neural Networks
CNN

and when a user clicks one of these categories they will be able to see all relevant sections for that item, and after selection a section, they can view all blocks associated with it

5. I want to change the way you interpret new code blocks
Currently it seems that they are stored as JSON within the builtins folder

I want to change it to be more ordered and quickly reproduceable
I created a "Categories" folder with several other category folders within it (Each are number labelled to indicate order)
Each category folder has a list of .py files that dictate the different sections for that category (Each are number labelled to indicate order)
in each .py file the first line has a comment 
# Category: _______
the value for category should be the name for the subsection
in the file there are several code blocks, the start and end of each code block is specified by
# START
and
# END
the next two lines after the start are
# Title: ______
# Output: _____
the value for title should be the name of that block 
and the output value should be the value for the output

after the output, and until the end of the file, is the actual python block code
I have already created some examples, look over how i did it, implement more examples for the rest, and adjust the code accordingly

Remember that the use should be able to navigate between category, and then section, and then select blocks that belong to that section (include a back button)

Also if easily possible, include a search button at the top, that performs a fuzzy search for related blocks, and navigates the user to that section, and focus on the block

6. Can we also make the drag animation more interactable, so the user can clearly see it while it is being dragged, currently they click+hold and place somewhere, seemingly teleporting

7. Can we make the input a green circle, and the output a red circle so it is clearer what goes where

8. Add a arrow incremently on the wires so the user can understand which way the data is flowing, as of right now its just a wire and unclear where the wire is going, and make the wire slightly thicker, just a little bit



# SECOND
1. When the user double clicks an existing block or wire (I assume it was programmed to be anywhere, but the feature ended up being like this), it creates a new block, remove this feature

2. Users should have a button to minimize the block palette, and a button to minimize the execution order

3. You did not properly implement the dragging feature, the blocks are still being teleported, the user cannot see the block being dragged by their cursor

4. Although I did specify that each block should show 10 lines, I did not mean always, it should show up-to 10 lines, if a block contains only 5 lines of code, minimize the block to fit that size, if a block has 50 lines, show only 10 lines, allowing them to use the scroll bar to navigate the code and make edits

5. The color of the components and text, should follow the theme of the users environment, however if there is some issue with using the theme, default to the current

6. The user should be able to user the "Cut" feature, to delete a wire connection

7. A new folder with new timestamp shouldn't be created, it should just ever create one folder, and at every update, overwrites the existing folder

8. There should also be support for undo/redo (ctrl z, ctrl y), that should restore the previous action, if within a block (it should reverse the changes made in that block), if nothing is selected, it should restore deleted blocks

9. When I try highlighting code within the view, it highlights it, but also drags the entire block to the where the cursor ends

10. Is it possible, that each of the blocks can have a terminal, just like jupyter notebook, where the output of that block will be shown there:
the terminal should be present below the code (should be able to display terminal outputs, but also graph outputs like matplotlib, etc)

11. Also it does not seem like i can paste content within blocks in the view, this should be a feature


# THREE
1. It is difficult to grab the blocks, can you create a slight raised block on the top left, that the user can easily grab and drag

2. Once the user minimizes either the Exceution Order or the Block Palette, they text just get squished horizontally, instead place the text vertically, and ensure there is a button to expand it as well as there currently is not one

3. The blocks are still teleporting whne the user grabs and move it to someplace else, it should be actively following the users cursor while grabbed, and upon release it should be placed 

4. Also is it possible, that when a user clicks run a certain block, all previous blocks are also run as well, in the event there are variables from the previous blocks that are needed (AN IMAGE IS PROVIDED TO SHOW MY ISSUE)

5. Also when i paste content in a block, it instead always pastes it in the last block, rather than where my cursor is placed within a different block

6. Also allow the user the ability to resize the size of Output (sometimes the image in the terminal output is far too large and you only see a small section), do not automatically resize, how it is already done is perfectly fine, however let the user extend the size of the output vertically and horizontally, the block should follow in expanding horizontally only (meaning the code (10 lines) and the title, etc stay the same)
